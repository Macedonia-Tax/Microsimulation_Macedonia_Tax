===================================

This repository was established for the World-Bank-sponsored training sessions that began during January 2020 in Warsaw. This initial repository is a clone of the repository from the World Bank's Revenue Academy github page.

Getting Started
---------------

If you want to **propose code changes**, follow the directions in the
[USA Tax-Calculator Contributor
Guide](https://github.com/PSLmodels/Tax-Calculator/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#tax-calculator-contributor-guide)
on how to clone the Poland-Tax Microsimulation_Poland git repository. Before developing
any code changes be sure to read completely the manual in this repository which is
useful in preparing a GitHub pull request that contains your proposed
code changes.  The step-by-step workflow used to create and modify a
new pull request has been documented for the USA Tax-Calculator in this
[workflow document](https://github.com/PSLmodels/Tax-Calculator/blob/master/WORKFLOW.md#tax-calculator-pull-request-workflow).
